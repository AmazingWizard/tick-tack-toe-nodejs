**Tic Tac Toe**

This is a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game built using Node.js. The server handles all game logic, all chat function, and calculates winning moves or draw games. This is my first Node app ever, and only my second or third time working heavily with JavaScript.

The node.js server doesn't handle webserver funtions, so you'll need to run it along side a webserver (for now). If you clone this you can do a 'grunt serve' to have grunt host the webserver for you and then simple run the server.js in the /js/ folder with node.

Currently, the Tic Tac Toe server will only handle one game at a time, but my next goal is to try and have the server handle multiple games at one time.
